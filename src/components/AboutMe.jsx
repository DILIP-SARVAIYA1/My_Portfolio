            Hey! I'm Dilip sarvaiya, I've been close to a computer since an
            early age, and been passionate about it ever since. I really liked
            to build stuff using no-code tools back in 2010, and from that, I
            explored how to code myself, fast-forward to today, I do programming
            in various languages and technologies, and had the privilege to
            worked in a Recruitment Company and a SaaS Company I'm interested in
            building something awesome with code and automate tasks with code,
            currently focused on Web & Mobile Development, Open Source and
            Competitive Programming When I'm not coding I play games with my
            friends, watch some show on Netflix.
